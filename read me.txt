Creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java using  can be done in the following steps:

1. Set up the project:
   - Launch Visual Studio Code and create a new Java project.
   - Create a new Java class named "TicTacToeGame" to house the game logic.

2. Initialize the game board:
   - Create a 3x3 2D array to represent the game board.
   - Populate the array with empty markers (e.g., " " or "_") to represent available spots.

3. Define the players and their markers:
   - Create variables to store player names and their respective markers (e.g., "X" and "O").

4. Implement the game loop:
   - Use a while loop to keep the game running until there is a winner or a draw.
   - Display the current state of the game board.

5. Get user input:
   - Prompt the current player for their move (e.g., row and column) using the Scanner class.
   - Validate the input to ensure it's within the valid range and an available spot.

6. Update the game board:
   - Place the current player's marker on the selected spot on the board.

7. Check for a win or draw:
   - After each move, check for a winning condition (three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or a draw (no available spots).
   - If there is a winner or a draw, exit the game loop.

8. Switch players:
   - Alternate between players after each successful move.

9. Display the result:
   - If there's a winner, display the player's name.
   - If it's a draw, display a draw message.

10. Allow replay:
   - Ask the players if they want to play again.
   - If yes, reset the game board and repeat the game loop.
   - If no, exit the program.

11. Test thoroughly:
   - Run the game and check for any bugs or issues.
   - Make sure all game conditions are handled correctly.

12. Optional: Enhancements:
   - Add more user-friendly features like displaying row and column labels on the board.
   - Implement error handling to handle invalid inputs gracefully.
   - Create an AI opponent to play against the player.

Remember to break down each step into functions to keep the code organized and easy to maintain. Following these steps, you can create a functional Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java using Visual Studio Code within 400 words.
